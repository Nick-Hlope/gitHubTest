# A simple python program
This is a simple python program that writes "Hello World" on the terminal. This was coded on GitHub codespaces, but can be run in any IDE with the correct prerequisites and extensions installed.

# Requirements
- Visual Studio Code
- Python Extension for Visual Studio Code

# Instructions
 - Open Visual Studio Code on your desktop or on [GitHub-codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) and click on "New Codespace".

- Open the Explorer tab by pressing Ctrl+Shift+E and create a new file by right-clicking

![new file](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3afc212-3c15-44df-9084-bfdcd238a3e9)

- Make sure that the file you save ends with the .py file extension

- Navigate to the extensions tab by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X and type Python in the search bar

![search for extension](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad61fa56-ae92-4cb1-b3d8-e445e5bead8e)

- If it's not installed already, the "Disable" button will say "Install" instead. Click on it to install the extension

  ![install extension](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/269e4f14-862e-41a2-9e1d-e8ccc7f83d8d)

- Now you can start coding your program, note the syntax

![hello](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad4da9e4-a515-4a63-9913-751e2d5de9fa)

- Click run on the top right-hand corner and this should be the output on the terminal:
